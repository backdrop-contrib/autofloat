  In .module file in the drupal_add_css() function added options to group the
  css with other modules (CSS_DEFAULT) and set the 'every_page' flag option to
  TRUE.
  Changed some enclosing of strings from double to single quotes.
  Removed all markup out of t() functions.
  In .module file using the l() function to get rid of the markup in the
  t() function.
  In .css files added #content to target the body besides .content. Inspecting 
  several drupal themes, this should cover most cases. Nevertheless added a note
  about it in the README.txt and inline comments in the css files.
  In the .install file avoided variable with markup and direct markup in $t()
  function.
  In the .install file added a line to clear the variable cache after uninstall.

  In .install file used db_delete to delete all the variable starting
  with "autofloat_%", although this method should be avoided for modules that
  might get extended by other modules and therefore might use the same variable
  prefix. Variable cache should be cleared with this method.
  In autofloat.admin removed autofloat_admin_settings_submit() as return
  system_settings_form($form) will accordingly save content in the variable
  table.
  In .module file wrapped up the conditional drupal_add_css() into a
  hook_init().
  In .module file access argument "administer site configuration" replaced with
  "administer text formats and filters". Makes more sense.

#1676038 comment #4 by drupaldrop:
  Added a 'Configure' link to the .info file to make the settings accessible
  from the modules overview page. Also added a notice with a link in the
  AutoFloat settings on the text format configuration page: "AutoFloat Filter
  settings are shared by all the text formats where it is enabled".

  Changed regex delimiting character from '~' to '@'.
  Enhanced readability of the regex, added an x-modifier to be able to split it
  over multiple lines and add inline comments. More info at
  http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/advanced-regular-expression-tips-and-
  techniques/#more-11011
  Added other inline comments to explain better the different parts of code.
  Added a right-to-left css file to swap floats on sites where both ltr and rtl
  versions of pages exist.

  Added CHANGELOG.txt.
