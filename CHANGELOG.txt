  In .install file used db_delete to delete all the variable starting
  with "autofloat_%", although this method should be avoided for modules that
  might get extended by other modules and therefore might use the same variable
  prefix.
  In autofloat.admin removed autofloat_admin_settings_submit() as return
  system_settings_form($form) will accordingly save content in the variable
  table.
  In . module file wrapped up the conditional drupal_add_css() into a
  hook_init().
  In .module file access argument "administer site configuration" replaced with
  "administer text formats and filters". Makes more sense.

  Added a 'Configure' link to the .info file to make the settings accessible
  from the modules overview page. Also added a notice with a link in the
  AutoFloat settings on the text format configuration page: "AutoFloat Filter
  settings are shared by all the text formats where it is enabled".

  Changes regex delimiting character from '~' to '@'.
  Enhanced readability of the regex, added an x-modifier to be able to split it
  over multiple lines and add inline comments. More info at
  http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/advanced-regular-expression-tips-and-
  techniques/#more-11011
  Added other inline comments to explain better the different parts of code.
  Added a right-to-left css file to swap floats on sites where both ltr and rtl
  versions of pages exist.

  Added CHANGELOG.txt.
